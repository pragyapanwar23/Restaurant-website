      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a focused sophomore currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies. I am eager to translate my academic knowledge into practical experience through an internship opportunity. I'm a highly motivated quick learner, with excellent communication and collaborative skills. I am eager to contribute to your institution and further develop my skills through hands-on experience. I believe that this internship will provide me with the opportunity to apply and expand upon the theoretical concepts I have learned in the classroom.</p>
